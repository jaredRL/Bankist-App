# Bankist-App
A single page app which allows select users to login, transfer funds, request a loan, or close their account. The app displays a live balance, debits and credits, a summary of ingoing/outgoing funds, and a total of interest earned. The transaction record can be sorted with the click of a button.

This app was designed and created by Jonas Schmedtmann, and presented for the purpose of education in his udemy.com course, 'The Complete JavaScript Course'. I coded along with the tutorial, paying great attention to the functionality of each line of code; and am therefore quite familiar with it.
